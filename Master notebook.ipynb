    "Since graduating from a health related course, I began thinking what I want to do for my career. Early on I realized that I no longer see myself in the expected path of becoming a clinician. What followed were several years of searching for my passion. Finally two years ago, I was involved in research and here I was introduced to data. I was thrilled when I got a chance to analyze the findings of the research. Due to this, I was driven to learn more about analyzing data and this led me to data science. Unfortunately, I do not know how to start learning data science. I feel that I am out of my depth since data science was far removed from my finished course. I tried applying to several data science program but I was lucky enough to be accepted. Now I decided to start the journey by myself; getting information from different free courses, blogs or free books. Now this is my notebook."
